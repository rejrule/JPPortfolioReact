        I completed a fullstack web development program at <span className="text-white font-bold">CodeBoxx</span>, where I built real-world applications across 16 hands-on modules. <br /><br />
        My experience includes working with <span className="text-white font-bold">front-end frameworks</span> like React and TailwindCSS, as well as <span className="text-white font-bold">back-end technologies</span> such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL.
        <br /><br />
        I focus on writing clean, well-structured code, and enjoy turning ideas into functional, responsive, and engaging web experiences.
